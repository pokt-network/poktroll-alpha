# POKTRoll <!-- omit in toc -->

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT GO TO PRODUCTION WITH THIS REPOSITORY**

This is an alpha version of trying to build Pocket on top of RollKit.

**poktroll** is a rollup built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli).

## Kubernetes LocalNet (WIP)

### TLDR

- Install Docker Desktop
- `kind create cluster`
- `make localnet_up`
- press space

### More info

Make sure you have a local Kubernetes cluster, such as [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) created and k8s context pointed to this cluster.

Start LocalNet:

```bash
make localnet_up
```

To delete resources created by LocalNet:

```bash
make localnet_down
```

## LocalNet

Following the tutorial here: https://rollkit.dev/tutorials

Start up a celestia localnet:

```bash
    make celestia_localnet
```

Try retrieving your Celestia token balance:

```bash
    make celestia_localnet_balance_check
```

Start up a poktroll localnet:

```bash
    make poktroll_local_start
```

## Testnet

Start up a celestia light node:

```bash
    make celestia_light_client_start
```

Start up a poktroll testnet:

```bash
    make poktroll_testnet_start
```

Try retrieving your Celestia testnet balance:

```bash
    make celestia_testnet_balance_check
```

## Poktroll commands

Send tokens on poktroll:

```bash
    make poktroll_send
```

Get token balances after/before transfer:

```bash
    make poktroll_balance
```

Get session data:

```bash
    make poktroll_get_session
```

## Cosmology frontend

Simply visit https://localhost:3000 after running

```bash
poktroll_cosmology_frontend
```

## Staking & Unstaking

Stake/unstake and query servicers with:

```bash
make servicers_get

make servicer1_stake
make servicers_get

make servicer2_stake
make servicers_get

make servicer3_stake
make servicers_get

make servicer1_unstake
make servicers_get

make servicer2_unstake
make servicers_get

make servicer3_unstake
make servicers_get
```

Stake/unstake and query applications with:

```bash
make apps_get

make app1_stake
make apps_get

make app2_stake
make apps_get

make app3_stake
make apps_get

make app1_unstake
make apps_get

make app2_unstake
make apps_get

make app3_unstake
make apps_get
```

## Getting a session

### App=app1 <> Servicer=svc1 <> Height=1

```bash
    # EXPECTED ERROR: This should error with a missing app
    make session_get_app1_svc1

    # Stake the app
    make app1_stake
    make apps_get

    # EXPECTED ERROR: This should error with a missing servicers
    make session_get_app1_svc1

    # Stake a servicer
    make servicer1_stake
    make servicers_get

    # EXPECTED SUCCESS: This should succeed now
    make session_get_app1_svc1
```

### Other apps & servicers

You can repeat the steps above for `servicer` 2&3, with `apps` 2&3 for `services` 2&3. The commands are customizable but the makefile helpers are there for convenience.

```bash
    make app1_stake
    make servicer1_stake
    make session_get_app1_svc1

    make app2_stake
    make servicer2_stake
    make session_get_app2_svc2

    make app3_stake
    make servicer3_stake
    make session_get_app3_svc3
```

## AUTOGENERATED README BELOW

## Get started

```bash
ignite chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com).

### Web Frontend

Ignite CLI has scaffolded a Vue.js-based web app in the `vue` directory. Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the app:

```bash
cd vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

The frontend app is built using the `@starport/vue` and `@starport/vuex` packages. For details, see the [monorepo for Ignite front-end development](https://github.com/ignite/web).

## Release

To release a new version of your blockchain, create and push a new tag with `v` prefix. A new draft release with the configured targets will be created.

```bash
git tag v0.1
git push origin v0.1
```

After a draft release is created, make your final changes from the release page and publish it.

### Install

To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

```bash
curl https://get.ignite.com/username/poktroll@latest! | sudo bash
```

`username/poktroll` should match the `username` and `repo_name` of the Github repository to which the source code was pushed. Learn more about [the install process](https://github.com/allinbits/starport-installer).
